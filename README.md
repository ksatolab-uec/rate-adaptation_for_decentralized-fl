# Implementation Example of Rate Adaptation Technique for Decentralized Federated Learning
* This code demonstrates the rate-adaptation algorithm proposed in the following paper:
  * Koya Sato and Daisuke Sugimura, "Rate-Adapted Decentralized Learning Over Wireless Networks," IEEE Trans. Cogn. Commun. Netw., vol.7, no.4, pp.1412-1429, Dec. 2021.
* You can evaluate the effect of $$\lambda_\mathrm{target}$$ on the average transmission rate, shown in Fig.11 in the above paper.
* This code can work with,
```
$python main.py
```
